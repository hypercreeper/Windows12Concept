# Windows 12 Concept

## Introduction
This is my attempt to create a concept of what Windows 12 might look like. 

## Current Features
You can currently do the following: 
 - Open multiple windows
 - Open Settings
 - Control settings
 - Maximize/restore windows
 - Minimize windows
 - Close windows
 - Use keybinds to do the above

## Current Supported Keybinds
| Keybind | Function |
| --- | --- |
| alt+t | Opens a new window |
| alt+w | Closes current focused window |
| alt+- | Minimize current focused window |
| alt+= | Maximize/restore current focused window |
| F11 | Enter fullscreen mode (can also be done from the settings) |

If you know/discover any issues, please don't hesitate to report it in the issues tab and I will gladly respond.
